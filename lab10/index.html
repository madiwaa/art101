					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Working with your partner, experiment with DOM manipulation.</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I followed the base code and instructions and had ran test with 
                        each section to debug as I went but I ran into a problem at the 
                        end where the java still wasnt working. I consolted my part and we 
                        found some small errors but still nothing that was significant enough 
                        to mak ethe code run effectively. I then went to wes bot where we 
                        looked over my code and still some small problems we couldnt fix. 
                        After continuously touching up the code I was able to fix it and 
                        have it run.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I really want to make sure Im taking note of what does and doesnt
                        work well for me so I dont run into these problems again or if I 
                        do I know how to solve them quicker. The projects simple base 
                        design works but Im going to continue to work on it and fix up the 
                        css fro styling after its been submitted.</p>
