					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>We made a window prompt that uses an external persons input to scramble their name.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I was missing a comma so that was throwing me off since vs code wanst showing me where 
                        it was, but it was that I needed to put one in. I also struggled a little bit with just 
                        starting the assignment, and had a small family emergency happen aswell 
                        which set me back.</p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I enjoyed the creating folders and sections for the assignment I really didnt get it at
                         first but after a while it was making sense and I enjoyed it. I also noticed after doing 
                         the coding more Im slowly enjoying it more, usually only when I understanding it though.
                         The assignment was overall not bad and I enjoyed playing around more with the js files 
                         I feel like Im getting it more, I just pick things up a little slower sometimes</p>
