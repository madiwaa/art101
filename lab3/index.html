			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structure and File Transfer</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>We needed to add in a photo to our main home page and and fill 
					out the about us section in refrence to ourselfs. Then take a screen 
					shot of the file structures and the homepage website to submit.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I was trying to figure out how to do grids and make the image of 
					me hover above the right side of the screen and I didnt get to fiuring 
					it out but I also wanted to add in a row of 3 photos next to eachother 
					next to the main one of me showing off some of my intrests.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I think the assignment overall was pretty simple but still open 
					enough for us to learn and add a little more than required so we 
					get some more coding experience through our own research which we 
					may learn more about in class. I did enjoy the assignment I liked 
					when I was able to figure out some of my challenges. Some I didnt 
					get like the one I put in the "challenges" section but I plan to 
					ask about it in section.</p>
