					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>We needed to place in a photo and  inport our js file with code into the bottom of this page, down in the "script output" section.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had a problem with the '/t' part in the script out put section. It kept having /t show up in all my lines in from of the make, model, color, 
						section.  But I fixed it by realizing I had put the wrong slash I had this / instead of the \ which really sucked I took about half an hour 
						trying to figure that out. But I got it. After a while... </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I felt more confident in this assignment actually even though I had lots of problems, with some help I fixed them and learned from it. I 
						was able to finish it pretty quickly too.  </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>The assignment was pretty easy for the most part and I feel like I learned alot from my problems actually so Im happy about that.</p>
					<div id="output"></div>

						<h2>Script Output</h2>
						<script src="js/lab.js"></script>
						<img class="picture-of-my-car" src="./img/my-carrr.webp">
						<p>Technically yes this is my car but its not actually my picture of my OWN car, this is basically what it looks like with 
							some gold wheels and a cargo camping box on top. THEN, thats my car.</p>
