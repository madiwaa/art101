					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Working with your partner, experiment with processing JSON from an API.</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The api content of new comics wasnt showing up but the error message worked</p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I tried many different solutions to figure out the problem I was facing, In the end I checked 
                        with a few different websites to find the error, I was not able to figure it 
                        out and I really wanted it to work but also part of thinks It kind of did because 
                        it was able to recognize there was an error and prompt the error code. It didnt seem 
                        to be teh API also because the endpoints were workig fine within the browser. 
                        I do wish that the actual code would work. Maybe after class is over I can look into it 
                        more. Also fropm looking at my js in the console or github you will see that there was 
                        old code I noted out because I was still working with it but was not able to get that 
                        one working so I had consulted wes bot and his website plus chat gpt for some extra 
                        help and was able to end up with a somewhat kind of working result. Not super proud 
                        of it though but it took a lot of time for it to even show something.</p>
